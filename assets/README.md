Description

This project was aimed at providing scientific data on markers of climate change. The project featured HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs.

Human activity is the principal cause of Earth Warming at an unprecedented rate - and hard science provides the unequivocal evidence to capture and show alarming changes in our global temperature, arctic ice, CO2 concentration and ocean warming.

We wanted to explore the scientific facts about global warming to understand at a deeper level what is occurring and if /what is being addressed in regards to solutions.

In addition we are inspired to disseminate the evidence to inform individuals, communities, and governments about the trajectory our planet is on - and what maybe possible.

Importantly, we wanted to build an awareness of the immediacy of forging solutions at a systemic level, so we collectively can harness adaptive solutions to reverse global warming. Ultimately we are focused on how we can change out-moded approaches by humans on our interaction with our earth, wildlife and eco-systems.

We have developed a comprehensive web application, that incorporates API functionality to deliver to users, specific climate data: accessed across various time periods - that drivers scientific data about key climate markers, and that presents a comparative understanding of climate shifts across specific time points.



Usage

To use the application, open the links below in your browser to view global warming data.

TODO The following is a screenshots of our project:
To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

Application directive

1.Select one of the climate markers i.e CO2
2.Type in a chosen year in the search box i.e 2010
3.Assess the value for the selected year
4.Your search history will be saved to compare with other selected years
5.Compare data to other climate markers
